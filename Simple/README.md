This Simple Server and Client set is to show the basic setup of the game
and how the clients and servers specified here (essentially IO on
both sides of a pipe) are separate from the game being interpreted.

At a later time, it may be necessary for a game state or client program
to be validated to be considered correct, but currently this is the
burden of the server being used.
